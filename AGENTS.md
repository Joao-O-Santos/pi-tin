# Agent instructions

This repository is a template for small, often toy-sized Pi projects.
Keep work proportionate to that scale.

## Before changing code

Read `PROJECT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `STYLE.md`. Inspect the
relevant code and tests before proposing new structure. Treat the
current repository state as more authoritative than an old plan or
comment.

## Design boundary

Prefer the smallest implementation that is easy to inspect. Use Node.js
and Pi primitives directly when they are sufficient. Prefer deleting
code to moving it behind a new abstraction.

Do not create frameworks, service layers, dependency injection,
compatibility shims, plugin systems, generic registries, or shared
utility packages without a concrete repeated need. A little duplication
is cheaper than a premature abstraction in these projects.

Keep each package understandable in one sitting. Split files when that
improves navigation, not to imitate a larger application architecture.

## Upstream policy

Track current upstream releases. Do not pin dependencies, actions, or
tool versions merely to preserve an old environment. Do not commit
`package-lock.json`.

When upstream breaks the project, update our implementation, tests, and
docs to work with current upstream behavior. Add backward-compatibility
code only when the user explicitly requires an older supported version.

## Style

Follow `STYLE.md`. Use tabs for code indentation where syntax permits
and keep Biome's line width at 100 characters. Hard-wrap ordinary
Markdown prose at 72 characters with the repository formatter.

Do not reformat generated files or syntax whose format forbids tabs.
YAML uses two-space indentation.

## Tests and verification

For behavior changes, add the smallest deterministic regression test
that would have caught the problem. Run `make verify` before reporting
completion. Run `make site` when documentation or site infrastructure
changes.

Do not claim checks passed unless they were actually run. Report
unavailable checks and their reason.

## Project state

Update `PROJECT.md` when accepted scope or direction changes. Update
`ARCHITECTURE.md` only after the implementation it describes is true.
Update `SYNC.json` after durable project artifacts are current, not
before.

Use temporary plans only for work that genuinely benefits from them.
Remove or collapse completed planning material rather than letting it
become historical clutter.

## Commits and releases

Commit subjects are imperative, begin with a capitalized verb, and stay
within 50 characters. Use `Add ...`, `Remove ...`, `Simplify ...`, or
similar present forms. Do not use `Added ...` and do not use prefixes
such as `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, or `docs:`.

Work in small verified commits. Do not tag, publish, or release without
explicit instruction.

GitLab is the sole release authority. GitHub is a mirror for
verification and Pages only. Do not add GitHub release or npm-publishing
workflows.
